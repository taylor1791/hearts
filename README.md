Hearts
======
A poor implementation of [Hearts](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/hearts/)
you should never use.

Getting Started
-------------
Why do you want to get started? No one should use this. It doesn't have good
test coverage, the interfaces are poor, and it is not under active development.
The only thing it really does is play a random game of hearts. And it doesn't
even do that well; it doesn't implement passing! See for yourself, `cargo run`
in the `auto_player` directory and watch the bugs scurry.
